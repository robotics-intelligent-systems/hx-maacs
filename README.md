# MAACS: Multihull Air Amphibious Carrier

A multihull is a boat or ship with more than one hull, whereas a vessel with a single hull is a monohull. The most common multihulls are catamarans (with two hulls), and trimarans (with three hulls). The directory structure includes a specific folder for each phase of development and engineering programs:

- **CAD**: For computer-aided design.
- **CAM**: Dedicated to the part manufacturing and assembly process.
- **CAS**: For simulation of end-to-end functionality and performance analysis.
