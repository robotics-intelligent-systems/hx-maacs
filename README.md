# MAACS: Multihull Air Amphibious Carrier

A multihull is a boat or ship with more than one hull, whereas a vessel with a single hull is a monohull. The most common multihulls are catamarans (with two hulls), and trimarans (with three hulls). LHD ships, or Landing Helicopter Docks, are multipurpose amphibious assault ships capable of operating as helicopter carriers and supporting landing crafts. They feature a well deck for launching and recovering landing craft and can carry a variety of aircraft, including helicopters and V/STOL (Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing) aircraft. USNS Bethesda (T-EMS-1) will be the seventeenth overall Spearhead-class expeditionary fast transport, and first of her Expeditionary Medical Ship class. The directory structure includes a specific folder for each phase of development and engineering programs:

- **CAD**: For computer-aided design. 
- **CAM**: Dedicated to the part manufacturing and assembly process.
- **CAS**: For simulation of end-to-end functionality and performance analysis.
